# SaarangDevopsApp

Most of the features ready. 
I still have get the table ready. 
There are  some bugs which for which I have an idea to resolve. Couldnt do it due to time issues.

I have used MERN stack to do the app. 

the .env file will send as an attachment to the mail.

To get the app running locally you will have to run the server and client different with " npm start " command.
