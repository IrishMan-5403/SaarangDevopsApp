# SaarangDevopsApp

Most of the features ready. 
I still have get the table ready. 
There are  some bugs which for which I have an idea to resolve. Couldnt do it due to time issues.

I have used MERN stack to do the app. 

To get the app running locally you will have to run the server and client different with " npm start " command.
